## Set Your Chat URL
Open TTS.py and look for this Section:
CONFIG â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
PIPER_EXE     = "./piper/piper.exe"
PIPER_MODEL   = "./models/en_US-amy-medium.onnx"
SITE          = "https://twitch.tv/YOURCHANNEL"     <-----------
SPOKEN_FILE   = "spoken_messages.json"

Change it to your own Twitch or Truffle chat URL:

site = "https://www.twitch.tv/YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME"
or
site = "https://chat.truffle.vip/browser-source/your-org/scene-x"

## Create filter.json
The reason why i can't add this, is because there are words in there that i can't openly share on github. But i have made some instructions here to create your own!
Create a file in the root of the project called "filter.json" with the following format:

{
  "banned_words": ["slur", "swear", "filterd_word"]
}

This will filter out inappropriate messages from being spoken.

## (OPTIONAL) Install other Piper TTS Models

Go to: https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices

Choose a model (example: en_US-amy-low)

Download and extract it into the models/ folder:

models/
    â”œâ”€â”€ donwloaded_model-medium.onnx       | Model
    â””â”€â”€ donwloaded_model-medium.onnx.json  | Config

Open TTS.py and look for this Section:
CONFIG â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
PIPER_EXE     = "./piper/piper.exe"
PIPER_MODEL   = "./models/en_US-amy-medium.onnx"
SITE          = "https://twitch.tv/YOURCHANNEL"     <-----------
SPOKEN_FILE   = "spoken_messages.json"
